Harbour.RedisSessionStateStore
==============================

This is a [Redis](http://redis.io/) based [SessionStateStoreProvider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178587.aspx)
written in C# using [ServiceStack.Redis](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis).

Installation
------------

1. You can either install using NuGet: `PM> Install-Package Harbour.RedisSessionStateStore`
2. Or build and install from source: `msbuild .\build\build.proj`

Usage
-----

Configure your `web.config` to use the session state provider with sentinel host
and port information:

```xml
<system.web>
  <sessionState mode="Custom" customProvider="RedisSessionStateProvider">
    <providers>
      <clear />
      <add name="RedisSessionStateProvider" 
           type="Harbour.RedisSessionStateStore.RedisSessionStateStoreProvider" 
           host="localhost:26379,localhost:26380" clientType="sentinel" />
    </providers>
  </sessionState>
</system.web>
```

This configuration will use a `PooledRedisClientManager` and use the default host
and port (localhost:6379). Alternatively you can use the `host` attribute 
to set a custom host/port. If you wish to change the client manager type to
`BasicRedisClientManager`, you can set the `clientType="basic"`.

If you require that a custom `IClientsManager` be configured (for example if you're
using an IoC container or you wish to only have one `IClientsManager` for your
whole application), you can do the following when the application starts:

```csharp
private IRedisClientsManager clientManager;

protected void Application_Start()
{
    // Or use your IoC container to wire this up.
    this.clientManager = new PooledRedisClientManager("localhost:6379");
    RedisSessionStateStoreProvider.SetClientManager(this.clientManager);

    // Configure options on the provider.
    RedisSessionStateStoreProvider.SetOptions(new RedisSessionStateStoreOptions()
    {
        KeySeparator = ":",
        OnDistributedLockNotAcquired = sessionId =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Session \"{0}\" could not establish distributed lock. " +
                              "This most likely means you have to increase the " +
                              "DistributedLockAcquireSeconds/DistributedLockTimeoutSeconds.", sessionId);
        }
    });
}

protected void Application_End()
{
    this.clientManager.Dispose();
}
```

Changelog
---------

### v1.3.0
- Use a distributed lock rather than the WATCH/UNWATCH pattern because
  it was causing issues.

### v1.2.0
- Always ensure UNWATCH is called.
- Retry a transaction once if it fails.

### v1.1.0
